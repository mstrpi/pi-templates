### some things i've been playing with as a newbie to the community.
### nothing is final yet, but still working out little kinks here and there. 
### i welcome all feedback as I have no clue what I'm doing, and have simply used what resources I have to accomplish little things I wanted to try. thanks in advance for any guidance!
